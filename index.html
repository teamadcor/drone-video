<p>We are currently looking for partners in Germany who are interested in drone racing, live streaming and 4k video with drones.
At this time we own 2 DJI Phantom 3 pro drones and are flying every single day (weather permitting).
Technology is advance in leaps and bounds to it is important to check back every now and again for crucial news flashes :)</p>

<p>It looks like Drone Deploy has done an amazing job creating drone mapping apps and cloud software that is perfectly suited to the DJI Phantom 3 drone.  I have made several attempts at 3d mapping and the results are breath-taking. I'll have links available as soon as it is possible to view them online without restrictions.</p>

<p>Team Adcor is doing its best to catch up with the competitors in the field of aerial photography and drone filming. We keep an out out for new ideas and breakthroughs like the Phantom 4 intelligent drone. With the new apps our drones can complete POV circle flights, Follow-Me, Waypoints and straight flight routes up to 2 km in distance.  Recently we are working on a live streaming event for a golf course near Hamburg, Germany.</p>
